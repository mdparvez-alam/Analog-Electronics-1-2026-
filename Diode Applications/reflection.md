# Reflection

## What I learned
I learned how to calculate thermal voltage using \(V_T = kT/q\) and how diode current changes exponentially using the Shockley equation. I also practiced analyzing circuits using the approximate diode model and ideal diode model.

## Main difficulty
The main difficulty was deciding whether each diode is ON or OFF based on polarity and then applying KVL/KCL correctly with the diode voltage drop.
