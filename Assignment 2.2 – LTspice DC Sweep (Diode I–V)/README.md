# Assignment 2.2 – Diode I–V Curve Using DC Sweep

**Course:** Analog Electronics 1 (IT24SP)  
**Student Name:** MD PARVEZ ALAM
**Tool:** LTspice

## DC Sweep Settings
- Voltage source: V1
- Sweep range: -2 V to +2 V
- Step size: 0.01 V

## Observation
The plot shows the diode I–V characteristic, where the diode current remains near zero in reverse bias and increases exponentially once the diode is forward biased.
