# Written Answers (Questions 1–3)

## Question 1  
**Describe the difference between n-type and p-type semiconductor materials.**

**Answer:**  
n-type and p-type semiconductors differ based on the type of impurity added and the majority charge carriers.

In an **n-type semiconductor**, a small amount of pentavalent impurity (such as phosphorus or arsenic) is added to pure silicon or germanium. These impurities have five valence electrons, so one extra electron becomes free. As a result, **electrons are the majority carriers**, while holes are minority carriers.

In a **p-type semiconductor**, trivalent impurities (such as boron or aluminum) are added. These impurities have three valence electrons, creating a deficiency of one electron, called a hole. Therefore, **holes are the majority carriers**, and electrons are minority carriers.

## Question 2  
**Describe in your own words the conditions established by forward- and reverse-bias conditions on a p–n junction diode and how the resulting current is affected.**

**Answer:**  
When a p–n junction diode is **forward biased**, the p-side is connected to the positive terminal of the supply and the n-side to the negative terminal. This reduces the width of the depletion region and lowers the barrier potential. As a result, charge carriers can cross the junction easily, and a **large current flows through the diode**.

When the diode is **reverse biased**, the p-side is connected to the negative terminal and the n-side to the positive terminal. This increases the depletion region width and the barrier potential. Because of this, **current flow is almost zero**, except for a very small leakage current caused by minority carriers.

## Question 3  
**Describe in your own words the meaning of the word ideal as applied to a device or a system.**

**Answer:**  
In electronics, the term **ideal** refers to a device or system that operates perfectly without any losses or limitations. An ideal device follows theoretical rules exactly and ignores practical imperfections such as resistance, power loss, temperature effects, or leakage current.

For example, an **ideal diode** has zero voltage drop when forward biased and blocks all current when reverse biased. Although ideal devices do not exist in real life, they are useful for understanding basic concepts and simplifying circuit analysis.
